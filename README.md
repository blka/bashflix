# Tips
* If the first torrent doesn't work, add `select` before `"query"` and then select a torrent from the list;
* Subtitles not synced? Press `j` to speed it up or `h` to delay it;
* What did I watch? Type `bashflix previously` to see which episodes you previoulsy watched;
* Update bashflix from time to time by running `bashflix update`.

# Disclaimer
bashflix is under development. If you want the newer features or bugs fixed, run `bashflix update` from time to time. Some torrents (and subtitles), specially older ones, will not be found or will have few peers, which will make the video stop multiple times. Sometimes, waiting a bit for the video to download works. Downloading files via torrents might be illegal, depending on the content, so be aware of copyright infringements. Use a VPN for privacy.
